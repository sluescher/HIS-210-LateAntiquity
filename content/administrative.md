**Diversity, Inclusion, and Support Statement**  
It is my goal that you and your peers experience our classroom as a safe and productive space where you can learn comfortably. I want to state explicitly that I not only welcome a diversity of backgrounds (including, but not limited to political views, religion, national origin, ancestry, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy and related conditions, age, marital or domestic partnership status, veteran status, and disability) but believe that it is an asset to all of us. The diversity of voices makes our research stronger, as it broadens the questions we ask and expands the approaches we use, ultimately shaping the answers we find.  
If you believe that experiences in or outside of class are negatively impacting your learning, please feel free to let me know (in person or via email).

**Pronouns**  
Pronouns are an important, yet often overlooked, aspect of daily social interactions. In this class, your pronouns will be respected and used according to your wishes. Please be conscious of your peersâ€™ pronouns and use them accordingly.

**Accessibility**  
Princeton welcomes students with disabilities and values their diverse experiences and perspectives. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in the classroom or when completing assignments or exams, please be aware that support is available to you. If you wish to request classroom accommodations, you can do so through the Office of Disability Services (ODS). If you have been approved for accommodations through the ODS, please contact me via email as soon as possible so we can develop a plan for implementation together.

**Academic Integrity**  
Intellectual honesty is vital to an academic community and for my fair evaluation of your work. For these reasons, all students in this course are expected to abide by the Honor Code on examinations and to complete their written work in accordance with University regulations.

**Generative AI Tools**  
The use of ChatGPT or other generative AI programs is not permitted for the completion any of the assignments in this class. Any work that a student turns in that has been written with a generative AI program, in part or in whole, will receive a grade of 0. Every single word of any written assignment that is turned in with your name on it should be written by you and not by generative artificial intelligence
