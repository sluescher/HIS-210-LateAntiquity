      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;policies&#34;&gt;Policies&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversity, Inclusion, and Support Statement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It is my goal that you and your peers experience our classroom as a safe and productive space where you can learn comfortably. I want to state explicitly that I not only welcome a diversity of backgrounds (including, but not limited to political views, religion, national origin, ancestry, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy and related conditions, age, marital or domestic partnership status, veteran status, and disability) but believe that it is an asset to all of us. The diversity of voices makes our research stronger, as it broadens the questions we ask and expands the approaches we use, ultimately shaping the answers we find.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you believe that experiences in or outside of class are negatively impacting your learning, please feel free to let me know (in person or via email).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
